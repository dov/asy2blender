# Intro

This is a a proof of concept connecting the output from the program Asymptote (https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) and prepares it in a form for Blender. (I was surprised that nobody seems to have done this in the past!) Asymptote is a command line program, created in 2002, with its mathematical roots originating in the TeX typesetting program from the middle of the 80â€™s. It has some unique capabilities with regards to solving global constraints for smooth connection of paths.
